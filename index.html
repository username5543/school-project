<h1>Native american residential schools</h1>
<hr>
<h2>thesis statement</h2>

<P1>When the English colonists opened up the first residential
    school, they became responsible for breaching the human 
    rights of the whole Native American population. The abuse that occurred 
    there slowly eradicated their right to practice their
    culture, religion, speak their language, and essentially  
    stripped them of their identities. Native peoples’ culture still hasn’t recovered from years of being
     destroyed and forgotten, and it will likely never be the same. </P1>

<h3>Backround</h3>
<p>The establishment of Indian residential schools was an attempt 
    <br>to assimilate Indigenous children into Euro-centric North American
     <br> culture, which began in the early 17th century when the first 
     <br>pilgrims began to colonize the states and canada. Relations 
     <br>between Natives and Colonizers were tense, and some attempt
     <br> at peace was made in the beginning, but lots of lives were
     <br> lost in the total of battles between Indians and Europeans.</p>

     <h4>Build Up</h4>
<p> The Indian Civilization Act Fund in 1819 compensated church officials <br>to work with government officers teaching Native children to speak English and worship the Christian god. They were also told to force people out of their homes to make way for new land owners. This act as well as societal pressure paved the way for residential schools to become widespread.</p>
<h4>heart of the story</h4>
<p>Although they were open for a total of 165 years, there are key points within that when things changed. In 1876, the Indian Act was put into place, requiring that every indigenous child receive an  education under Christians or Europeans. It is estimated that native boarding schools killed around 6,000 children, although no records were kept at the time so that number may 
    be larger than we know. The reason that schools were so cruel and likely differed from person to person, but one of their main goals was to spread Christianity. They did this by insisting that Native kids’ religions and languages were devilish and evil.

    <h4>short term effects</h4>
    <p1>Children were killed at these schools, or abused and traumatized so much that their lives could never be normal again. And while this might not be the case for every child that attended these schools, a large part of the Indigenous population will never recover their cultures or languages because of the abuse and genocide happening at Native boarding schools.
